setting up on a local server
--------
we are using html5mode for this app, and our apache server is configured for this. most local environments aren't, though.  

look [here](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#how-to-configure-your-server-to-work-with-html5mode) to get everything working properly for you.  

if you don't want to do that, you won't be able to refresh. this means you'll have to enter localhost:8000 or whatever back into your browser and navigate to the page you are working on.  

todo
--------
- change 'pledge' to 'donate' and redesign the page
- add google analytics
- make an ADA compliant fallback site lol (this admin told us we have to)
- make favicon stop reloading (?) on every page
